# Python School Projects Repository
## Overview
This repository contains my Python programming assignments, exercises, and personal projects created as part of my coursework. The purpose of this repository is to practice programming concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and demonstrate my progress in Python development.
The projects range from basic programs using input and conditionals to more advanced programs involving loops, functions, and data structures.

## Topics Covered
### This repository includes programs demonstrating:
- Variables and data types  
- User input and output  
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions  
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- String manipulation  
- Basic data processing  
- Simple project design
